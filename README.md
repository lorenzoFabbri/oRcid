## Installation

You can install the development version of oRcid from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("lorenzoFabbri/oRcid")
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(oRcid)
## basic example code

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
